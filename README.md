An awesome list of awesome documentation and documentation resources. Documentation is part of what makes a resource, and in particular APIs, awesome. There are many ways of making good documentation, but very few frameworks are good at being awesome. Let's find them and list them here. 

#### Contributing

_[Here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) are instructions on how to to open a PR and submit a link to any list. For this list, please follow the general style below, and add a comment for any link you add explaining why it is awesome. Please alphabetize links, too._

### Awesome Docs

 * [Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/) Custom, easy to edit (the team is pretty responsive about editing their docs), and on the whole, quite comprehensive.
 * [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) This is how docs should look. Absolutely well done. 

### Documentation Resources

 * [Readme.io](https://readme.io/) This company focuses on making your docs as beautiful as possible, and as easy as possible. They're responsive and I find that their examples are well thought out.
 * [Swagger.io](http://swagger.io/) Brilliant resources to help make your in-code comments turn into beautiful docs by having an interoperable standard. A huge community has been built around them, too.
