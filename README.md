An awesome list of awesome documentation and documentation resources. Documentation is part of what makes a resource, and in particular APIs, awesome. There are many ways of making good documentation, but very few frameworks are good at being awesome. Let's find them and list them here. 

#### Contributing

_[Here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) are instructions on how to to open a PR and submit a link to any list. For this list, please follow the general style below, and add a comment for any link you add explaining why it is awesome. Please alphabetize links, too._

### Awesome Docs

 * [Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/) Custom, easy to edit (the team is pretty responsive about editing their docs), and on the whole, quite comprehensive.
 * [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) This is how docs should look. Absolutely well done.

### Documentation Resources

 * [Documentationjs](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation) This looks fairly good, and is starting to mature. Their integrations look pretty fantastic, too. Only for js.
 * [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) ExDoc produces HTML and online documentation for Elixir projects. They are from my knowledge the best auto generated docs any language has. [Example](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/elixir/Kernel.html). ~[@Dignifiedquire](https://github.com/Dignifiedquire)
 * [Readme.io](https://readme.io/) This company focuses on making your docs as beautiful as possible, and as easy as possible. They're responsive and I find that their examples are well thought out.
 * [Swagger.io](http://swagger.io/) Brilliant resources to help make your in-code comments turn into beautiful docs by having an interoperable standard. A huge community has been built around them, too.
 * [Write The Docs](http://docs.writethedocs.org/#) "Write the Docs is a place where the art and science of documentation can be practiced and appreciated. There are a lot of people out there who write docs, but there isnâ€™t a good place to go to find information, ask questions, and generally be a member of a community of documentarians." Arguably the best resource for documentation, in general. - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)
